#### Expect Lab task
Using React, create a web page with 3-4 input fields (for example, Last Name, First Name, Email - input fields, Comment - textarea), a color picker widget, and a button.

After clicking the button, the user-entered values should appear in a block on the web page below the button, with the selected color as the background. The form should be cleared. The user should have the option to enter data into the form again, choose a color, and upon clicking the button, the new values should appear below the previous block with a different background, and so on.
